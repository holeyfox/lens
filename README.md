# lens starter
random experimentations with the lens API.

### Getting started
Fork the repository, and install dependencies:
```yarn```
Run the local server:
```yarn dev```

### Submit improvements
I cannot stress how much this is still in WIP stages. It's a good starter if you're looking to muck around with the lens API, but a lot needs to be done.
